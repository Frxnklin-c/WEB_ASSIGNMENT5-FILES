      <h1>About the Creator</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Franklin Chukwuemeka, and I'm currently a student in the Computer
        Programming & Analysis program at Seneca College. I've always had a strong interest in
        design and technology, and this project gave me a chance to bring both together in a
        creative way.
      </p>

        This website was built as part of a WEB222 assignment. I decided to focus on sneakers
        because Iâ€™ve always appreciated how they blend style, innovation, and culture. Whether it's
        performance runners or high-fashion drops, there's a story behind every pair, and I wanted
        to share that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to live music, and learning how
        different technologies shape the world around us. This project reflects my personal style
        and gave me the opportunity to apply real-world HTML and CSS skills in a practical setting.
      </p>
